Affordable Simple Bookcase. It was easy to assemble. No missing parts. If I need to get another one, I would buy it again.
So this isn’t a super quality bookcase but just what I was looking for. For the price it’s honestly better than expected. Pretty simple to put together. I bought it for my sons room and it does the job!
Quality is okay and it was very easy to put together, but when all done it’s just wasn’t the look I was going for. Purchased 2 and returned 2. Very cheap looking. Looks better in the advertisement.
You can't beat this deal. Good quality, stylish, and a great price.
Easy to put together! Nice shelf just a tad rocky
This bookshelf is surprisingly good quality for the price - the box said "Made in Italy" which was unexpected. It took about 40 minutes to put together with the help of a toddler. Clear directions and pretty easy to not screw up; will need a screwdriver and hammer. The bookshelf is perfect for most toddler books - but is not deep enough for some of the horizontal titles; they stick out. This wouldn't be the best shelf for larger artbooks or text books, but for kid books, novels, and media it is perfect. It is not deep enough for most baskets and bins (see photo) but is slim enough to be tucked in our hallway "nook" with a small footprint.
The bookshelf itself it nice but I’m not happy about the wall anchor. I put the drywall anchor in according to the instructions. However, the screw is too long so it doesn’t screw in all the way. Now I’ve got to rip out the plastic anchor part and get something bigger since there is a big hole in my wall.
Such a mistake. Poor quality. On first step, you insert dowels in top and bottom shelf; second step, use screws to attach sides. BUT! As you tighten screws, the dowels end up breaking through their holes. Back in step one, you need to have shoved the dowels much farther into the shelves - farther than you might want (for fear of breaking the shelves). I’m a strong guy, but not Hulk strong - how could my tightening the screws be powerful enough to pull the dowels through the sides?? Wouldn’t you think the pressure would push the dowels further into the shelves, rather than through the cheap plywood and out of the sides? Weird.
Good quality for the price and quick assembly. Would be a great size and option for a dorm room.
