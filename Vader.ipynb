The bookshelf is perfect for most toddler books - but is not deep enough for some of the horizontal titles; they stick out. This wouldn't be the best shelf for larger artbooks or text books, but for kid books, novels, and media it is perfect.

I’m a strong guy, but not Hulk strong - how could my tightening the screws be powerful enough to pull the dowels through the sides??
